Disclamer: I do not have 2 computers here at vacation. So I have tested scripts using one PC on WIN10.

Project structure:

classes.py - socket classes and their logics

body_client.py - logic of messanger applications, and dictionary of messages for bots, that excheged with.

test_client.py - "local" copy of messenger 

test_client2.py - "remote" copy of messenger 

To launch the application you have to launch the test_client.py and test_client2.py in different shells or on different PC. In case you use different PC (different interfaces), you have to make changes in this section of test_client*.py files:

TARGET_HOST = 
TARGET_READER_PORT = 
TARGET_SENDER_PORT =
